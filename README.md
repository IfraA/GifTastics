GIPHY API

* I created a Gif Tastic Fun App using the Giphy API.

* Here is the documentation for the Giphy API: https://ifraa.github.io/GifTastics/*

* An array of reactions was created to make buttons.

* When the user clicks on a button, 10 images are retrieved from giphy and displayed on the page.

* The Gif is displayed still and only when the user clicks on the image, the Gif starts animating. The Gif can be stopped again by clicking on the moving Gif.

* User can add their own reactions using the form. Each new button will function the same way displaying Gifs.
